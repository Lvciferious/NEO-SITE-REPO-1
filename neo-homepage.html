                                In the gaming industry, there have been
                                space operas, gritty cyberpunk action romps, and futuristic horror. But, what if as a gamer,
                                you wanted something a little more...mundane? In titles and franchises that are increasingly open-world there is,
                                of course, the option to skip mainlne quests and explore as you please, doing side quests, and the like.
                                For games that have the community behind it, you can also download mods to shape your favourite
                                existing games to more of your liking. But, what would it be like to have a game where you could
                                be a part of those same worlds, with a more slice-of-life twist?

                                In NEO/topium, you can do exactly that. Enter a futuristic world where the joys of it involve day-to-day
                                activies; buy your first home on the Moon, take a vacation to Martian beaches; do grocery shopping in the
                                Andromeda galaxy, or a routine check-up in the Pleiades star cluster. Go to work, go to school, date, and work
                                in stations orbiting the earth.

                                The future has arrived, and now is your chance to live it.
